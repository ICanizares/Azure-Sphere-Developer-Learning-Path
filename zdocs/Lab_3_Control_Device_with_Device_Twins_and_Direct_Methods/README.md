## What you will learn

You will learn how to control an [Azure Sphere](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-sphere/?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) application using [Azure IoT Central](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/iot-central/?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) Properties and Commands.

---

## Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have completed [Lab 2: Send Telemetry from an Azure Sphere to Azure IoT Central](../Lab_2_Send_Telemetry_to_Azure_IoT_Central/README.md). You will have created an Azure IoT Central application, connected Azure IoT Central to your Azure Sphere Tenant, and you have configured the **app_manifest.json** for Azure IoT Central.

## Tutorial Overview

There are three options for Azure IoT cloud to device communications: 

1. [Direct Methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) for communications that require immediate confirmation of the result. Direct methods are often used for interactive control of devices, such as turning on a fan.

2. [Device Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) are for long-running commands intended to put the device into a certain desired state. For example, set the sample rate for a sensor to every 30 minutes.

3. [Cloud-to-device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-messages-c2d?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) messages are for one-way notifications to the device app.

This lab will cover Azure IoT Device Twins and Direct Methods.

---

## Key Concepts

In Lab 1, **Peripherals** and **Event Timers** were introduced to simplify and describe GPIO pins and Event Timers and their interactions.

In this lab, **DeviceTwinBindings**, and **DirectMethodBindings** are introduced to simplify the implementation of Azure IoT [Device Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) and Azure IoT [Direct Methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) on the device.

Both Device Twins and Direct Methods provide a mechanism to invoke functionality on a device from a custom Azure IoT Hub application or from an Azure IoT Central Application. For example, you may want to turn on a light, start a fan, or change the sensor sample rate.

---

## Azure IoT Device Twins

Device twins are JSON documents that store device information, including metadata, configurations, and conditions. Azure IoT Hub keeps a device twin for each device that you connect to IoT Hub. Azure IoT Central is an application built on Azure IoT Hub, and it uses device twins to manage properties.

You can use device twins as follows: 

1. Cloud to device updates.

	A user sets an Azure IoT Central device property. For example, to set the temperature of a refrigerator. IoT Central sends a desired property device twin message to the device. The device implements the desired property, and then the device responds with a reported property device twin message. Azure IoT Hub stores the reported property. 
2. Device to cloud updates.

	A device can send a reported property device twin message to Azure. For example, a device could report its firmware level on startup.  Azure IoT Hub stores the reported property. 

3. Querying reported properties.

	With device twins reported state stored in Azure, it is possible to query the stored device twin properties cloud side. For example, list all devices with a firmware version less than 2.0, as these devices require an update. Or, list all refrigerators with a temperature setting higher than 3 degrees Celsius. 

The following outlines how Azure IoT Central uses Device Twins to set properties on a device: 

1. A user sets the value of a property in Azure IoT Central. For example, change the blink rate of a status LED. 
2. Azure IoT Hub sends a desired property message to the device. 
3. The device implements the desired property; in this case, change the LED blink rate. 
4. The device sends a reported property message back to Azure IoT. In this example, the device would report the new LED blink rate. 
5. Azure IoT Central queries and displays the devices reported property data.

## Device Twin Bindings

Azure IoT Central properties are implemented on Azure IoT Hub device twins. Device Twin Bindings map a device twin with a device property and a handler function that implements the action.

### Cloud to Device Updates

The following example declares a variable named **led1BlinkRate** of type **DeviceTwinBinding**. This variable maps the Azure IoT Central *LedBlinkRate* property with a handler function named **DeviceTwinBlinkRateHandler**.

```c
static DeviceTwinBinding led1BlinkRate = { 
	.twinProperty = "LedBlinkRate", 
	.twinType = TYPE_INT, 
	.handler = DeviceTwinBlinkRateHandler 
};
```


The following is the implementation of the handler function **DeviceTwinBlinkRateHandler**. The handler function is called when the device receives a **LedBlinkRate** desired property message from Azure IoT Central.

```c
/// <summary>
/// Set Blink Rate using Device Twin "LedBlinkRate": {"value": 0}
/// </summary>
static void DeviceTwinBlinkRateHandler(DeviceTwinBinding* deviceTwinBinding) {
	switch (deviceTwinBinding->twinType) {
	case TYPE_INT:
		Log_Debug("\nInteger Value '%d'\n", *(int*)deviceTwinBinding->twinState);

		Led1BlinkIntervalIndex = *(int*)deviceTwinBinding->twinState % led1BlinkIntervalsCount;
		ChangeTimer(&led1BlinkTimer, &led1BlinkIntervals[Led1BlinkIntervalIndex]);

		break;
	default:
		break;
	}
}
```

### Device to Cloud Updates

The following example declares a ButtonPressed device twin property of type string. There is no handler function registered as this is a one-way device to cloud binding.

```c
static DeviceTwinBinding buttonPressed = { 
	.twinProperty = "ButtonPressed", 
	.twinType = TYPE_STRING 
};
```

The ButtonPressed reported property message is sent to IoT Central by calling the DeviceTwinReportState function. You must pass a property of the correct type.

```c
DeviceTwinReportState(&buttonPressed, "ButtonA");   // TwinType = TYPE_STRING
```

---

## Azure IoT Central Properties

Azure IoT Central properties are defined in Device templates.  

1. From Azure IoT Central, navigate to **Device template**, and select the **Azure Sphere** template.
2. Click on **Interface** to list the interface capabilities.
3. Scroll down and expand the **LedBlinkRate** capability.
4. Review the definition of **LedBlinkRate**. The capability type is **Property**, the Schema type is **Integer**, and the property is **Writeable**. Writeable means this property is enabled for Cloud to Device updates.

---

## Azure IoT Direct Methods

The following outlines how Azure IoT Central Commands uses Azure IoT Hub Direct Methods for cloud to device control.

1. A user invokes an Azure IoT Central Command. Azure IoT Hub sends a Direct Method message to the device. For example, reset the device. This message includes the method name and an optional payload. 
2. The device receives the direct method message and calls the associated handler function 
3. The device implements the direct method; in this case, reset the device. 
4. The device responds with an HTTP status code, and optionally a response message. 

![](resources/azure-direct-method-pattern.png)

For more information, refer to the [Understand and invoke direct methods from IoT Hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-direct-methods?WT.mc_id=github-blog-dglover) article.

---

## Direct Method Bindings

Direct Method Bindings map a direct method with a handler function that implements an action.

### Cloud to Device Commands

In main.c the variable named resetDevice of type DirectMethodBinding is declared. This variable maps the Azure IoT Central ResetMethod command property with a handler function named ResetDirectMethod.

```c
static DirectMethodBinding resetDevice = { 
	.methodName = "ResetMethod", 
	.handler = ResetDirectMethod 
};
```

---

## Azure IoT Central Commands

Azure IoT Central commands are defined in Device templates.

1. From Azure IoT Central, navigate to **Device template**, and select the **Azure Sphere** template.
2. Click on **Interface** to list the interface capabilities.
3. Scroll down and expand the **ResetMethod** capability.
4. Review the definition of **ResetMethod**. The capability type is **Command**.
5. The schema type is **Object**. Click on the **view** button to display the object definition. The Object definition describes the shape of the JSON payload sent with the command. In this example, the shape of the JSON payload will be the same as this example *{"reset_timer":5}*.

![](resources/iot-central-device-template-interface-fan1.png)

---

## Direct Method Handler Function

1. From Azure IoT Central, a user invokes the **Reset Azure Sphere** command. 

	A Direct Method named **ResetMethod**, along with a JSON payload, is sent to the device. The JSON payload *{"reset_timer":5}* specifies how many seconds to wait before resetting the device.

2. The ResetDirectMethod function handler is called.

	When the device receives a Direct Method message, the DirectMethodBindings Set is checked for a matching DirectMethodBinding *methodName* name. When a match is found, the associated DirectMethodBinding handler function is called.

3. The current UTC time is reported to Azure IoT using a Device Twin Binding property named **DeviceResetUTC**.

4. The Direct Method responds back with an HTTP status code and a response message

5. The device is reset.

6. Azure IoT Central queries and displays the Device Twin reported property **DeviceResetUTC**.

![](resources/azure-sphere-method-and-twin.png)

```c
/// <summary>
/// Start Device Power Restart Direct Method 'ResetMethod' {"reset_timer":5}
/// </summary>
static DirectMethodResponseCode ResetDirectMethod(JSON_Object* json, DirectMethodBinding* directMethodBinding, char** responseMsg) {
	const char propertyName[] = "reset_timer";
	const size_t responseLen = 60; // Allocate and initialize a response message buffer. The calling function is responsible for the freeing memory
	static struct timespec period;

	*responseMsg = (char*)malloc(responseLen);
	memset(*responseMsg, 0, responseLen);

	if (!json_object_has_value_of_type(json, propertyName, JSONNumber)) {
		return METHOD_FAILED;
	}
	int seconds = (int)json_object_get_number(json, propertyName);

	if (seconds > 0 && seconds < 10) {

		// Report Device Reset UTC
		DeviceTwinReportState(&deviceResetUtc, GetCurrentUtc(msgBuffer, sizeof(msgBuffer)));			// TYPE_STRING

		// Create Direct Method Response
		snprintf(*responseMsg, responseLen, "%s called. Reset in %d seconds", directMethodBinding->methodName, seconds);

		// Set One Shot Timer
		period = (struct timespec){ .tv_sec = seconds, .tv_nsec = 0 };
		SetOneShotTimer(&resetDeviceOneShotTimer, &period);

		return METHOD_SUCCEEDED;
	}
	else {
		snprintf(*responseMsg, responseLen, "%s called. Reset Failed. Seconds out of range: %d", directMethodBinding->methodName, seconds);
		return METHOD_FAILED;
	}
}
```

---

## Working with Device Twins and Direct Method Binding

Device twin and direct method bindings must be added to their respective **sets**. When a device twin or direct method message is received from Azure, these sets are checked for a matching *twinProperty* or *methodName* name. When a match is found, the corresponding handler function is called.

```c
DeviceTwinBinding* deviceTwinBindingSet[] = { &led1BlinkRate, &buttonPressed, &relay1DeviceTwin, &deviceResetUtc };
DirectMethodBinding* directMethodBindingSet[] = { &resetDevice };
```

### Opening

Sets are initialized in the **InitPeripheralsAndHandlers** function found in **main.c**.

```c
OpenDeviceTwinSet(deviceTwinBindingSet, NELEMS(deviceTwinBindingSet));
OpenDirectMethodSet(directMethodBindingSet, NELEMS(directMethodBindingSet));
```

### Dispatching

When a Device Twin or Direct Method message is received, their respective sets are checked for a matching *twinProperty* or *methodName* name. When a match is found, the corresponding handler function is called.

### Closing

Sets are closed in the **ClosePeripheralsAndHandlers** function found in **main.c**.

```c
CloseDeviceTwinSet();
CloseDirectMethodSet();
```
